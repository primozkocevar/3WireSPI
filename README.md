# SPI_3-wire_encoder
3-wire SPI library implemented from scratch for communication with Contelect Vert-X 13 encoders. 
Library was used with an Arduino Mega ADK low-level board on 23.2.2018 and was working with multiple slaves.
Pin mapping is set in the encoder.h file and can thus be changed apropriately.
For a more detailed description of the whole project refer to the literature folder.
