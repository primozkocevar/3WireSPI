# 3 Wire SPI library for encoders.
  - 3-wire SPI library implemented from scratch for communication with Contelect Vert-X 13 encoders. 
  - Library was used with an Arduino Mega ADK low-level board on 23.2.2018 and was working with multiple slaves.
  - Pin mapping is set in the encoder.h file and can thus be changed apropriately.
